# Objectives 

### Main Objectives
- **Data Visuals: Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from the data set that are interesting to you.
- **Which start/stop stations are most popular?
- **What is the average distance traveled?
- **How many riders include bike sharing as a regular part of their commute?

# How objectives were completed
I tried to export the code that I had written in Python for my data analysis as a JSON/JS Module that I could plug right into the HTML code to make it interactive within the web-app, but I was facing difficulties doing that. Therefore, I decided to export the Python code as a .png file, which I plugged into the HTML Code. If I had experience with JS, I would've loved to make the web-app more interactive, but i still believe that my current code serves the purpose! I really enjoyed working with the UX.

Otherwise, I loved learning more about HTML and the different libraries within python through this development process.
